Notes:
I have mostly given up on building this from the ground up. So back to the fork idea!
And when it comes to forking, I will be forking hard, not hardly forking.

BunnyMinterV2 -> mints bunny as long as the caller is an approved minter. Also handles fees
Flip2Flip -> The auto compounder, am going to let it still use cake
zap -> handles swaps "easier"


The goal here is to make progress by deploying contracts, and building the deployment script as I go
